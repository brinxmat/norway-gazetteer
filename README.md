norway-gazetteer
================

An RDF representation of an historical gazetteer of Norway; data is retrieved from multiple sources and is liable to change.

At the moment, there is a multistage, iterative plan:

1) Identify the relevant features and document these with class information, names and dates
2) Add relations between the features
3) Add geographical data
4) Revise

This data is being used in one of our core applications, and while I'm using the data myself, I'm not promising 100% accuracy or stability (and anyone who is is lying because this stuff is stupidly complex).
